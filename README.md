📚 Data Structures & Algorithms Practice

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice repository!

This repo contains my personal journey of solving coding problems while learning and improving problem-solving skills in computer science fundamentals.

🚀 Purpose

Strengthen my understanding of algorithms and data structures

Prepare for coding interviews

Build a long-term coding habit

Keep a track of problems solved across different platforms like LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks, Codeforces, etc.

🗂️ Folder Structure

dsa-practice/

├── README.md

├── linked_lists/
│   └── reverseLinkedList.py

├── arrays/
│   └── twoSum.py

├── recursion/
│   └── factorial.py
└── ...

Each folder contains solutions related to that specific topic/category.

📌 Topics need to cover

✅ Arrays & Strings

✅ Linked Lists

✅ Stacks & Queues

✅ Trees

✅ Graphs

✅ Recursion & Backtracking

✅ Sorting & Searching

✅ Dynamic Programming

✅ Miscellaneous Challenges

✏️ Naming Convention

Each file name corresponds to the problem title, and solutions are written in Python mainly.

🧩 Example Problems

linked_lists/reverseLinkedList.py → Reverse a singly linked list

arrays/twoSum.py → Two Sum problem

More to come...

✨ Future Goals
Complete major DSA topics

Attempt 200+ DSA problems by [15 july 2025]

Start contributing to open-source DSA projects
